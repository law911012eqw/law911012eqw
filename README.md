About me: 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently self-teaching myself using online resources on how to write a code using the programming language: Javascript and Julia.
- ðŸ’¬ Who am I?: I'm Beaver Bryan Antipolo, known as Laweqw (Lo-ku-we) or Sabo. I decided to be a programmer mainly to help others especially those who urgently needs it (make the world a better place). I'm currently working on my skills to be a coder specifically web dev as a starting point which I think it's not the best position. I'm still debating against myself whether pursuing field related to psychology or keep moving forward as a programmer (or both) could be the the best move to which these two are the most archetypal candidates that eventually leads to accomplishment of my main goal.
