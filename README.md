About me: 
- ðŸ’¬ Who am I? I'm Beaver Bryan Antipolo, known as Laweqw (Lo-ku-we) or Sabo.  I'm currently working on my skills to be a coder specifically web dev as a starting point which I think it's not the best position. 
- :telescope: Forging my own path: Currently polishing my coding skills to be a Full Stack Dev as a starting point.
- :closed_book: Fun Facts: Self-studying Carl Jung's works is one of my top wishlist, I enjoy achievement/trophy hunting in video games than the video game itself and I have multiple interests and passions (check multipotentialite).
