About me: 
- ðŸ’¬ Who am I? I'm Beaver Bryan Antipolo, known as Laweqw (Lo-ku-we) or Sabo. I'm currently working on my skills to be a coder specifically web dev as a starting point which I think it's not the best position. 
- :telescope: Forging my own path: I have decided to be a programmer mainly to help others especially those who urgently needs it (make the world a better place). I'm still debating against myself whether pursuing field related to psychology or keep moving forward as a programmer (or both?) could be the the best move to which these two are the most archetypal candidates that'll eventually leads to accomplishment of my top goal.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- :closed_book: Fun Fact: I love Carl Jung's works.
